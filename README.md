## Objective
* Our objective is to provide a solution to the problem of where the vaccine should be delivered first, accross the whole nation. Furtheremore, it'll be even better if we could predict the percentage of total dose that should be delivered there.
The priority can be classified on the base of multiple criterion, viz.:
  * states or union-teritories
  * districts or provinces
  * age-group
  * employees' group
